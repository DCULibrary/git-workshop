So weâ€™ve done a lot on Git. Weâ€™re now going to look at how along with Git to preserve and record your own work, we can use Github to share that - including all its recorded changes. This can enable group collaboration or give you a stable way to work from two different machines.

Open Github and login to the account you have created. Create a new repository on Github, give it the name _gitlesson_. For now donâ€™t add a `readme.md` or `.gitignore` file just click `Create repository`

Connect your local repo to the Github repo (at the moment they donâ€™t know anything about each other). Copy the Github repo url and then go back to our Git Bash window.

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/liamodwyer/gitlesson.git
```
[_origin_ in the `git remote add` line is a short alias weâ€™re giving to that long repository URL. It could be anything, but by convention in Git, it is usually called `origin`]
```
$ git remote â€“v
```
Now we have established a connection but we havenâ€™t synchronised the content. To send our content from the local to the remote we use the Git push command

### Pushing Changes

We â€˜pushâ€™ our local changes to the Github repo. You will be prompted for your Github login during this process.

```
$ git push â€“u origin master		
  Counting objects: 3, done.
  Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 226 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
  Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  To https://github.com/<your_github_username>/gitlesson
  * [new branch]      master -> master
  Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
```
Go to Github and refresh. We have the file and we also have the commit history

Weâ€™ll just check that we are up to date with our remote (now that we have a remote, `git status` output includes that info). If we had made changes from elsewhere (or someone else had) which caused the remote/Github content to be ahead of our local version, we might want to bring the Github content into our local repository. To do that we use `git pull`
```
$ git pull origin master
```
(but this will say they are up to date)

### Pulling Changes

So now we have gone as far as we go in one direction...
* we created content in a working directory
* we staged that content
* we committed it to the local repository
* now we have pushed that repository to a remote Github repository

So just to show that we can work in the other direction too, where the Github repository becomes the _source_, we will create a separate _laptop_ folder and imagine that this could be a second device you want to be able to manage this project from.
```
$ cd ~/desktop
$ mkdir laptop
$ cd laptop
$ git clone https://github.com/liamodwyer/gitlesson.git
$ ls 					(to show that the gitlesson directory is now there)
$ cd gitlesson 			(to move into that repository)
```
So we have essentially an up-to-date repository in three places - two separate Git repositories and one on Github.

The image below shows the commands and workflow we have implemented in this lesson using Git and Github:

</p>

* creating files in the working directory
* adding them to the staging area
* committing them to the local repository
* checking out files from the repository back to the working directory
* pushing the directory and files to a remote repository
* pulling from that remote repository to another local repository

#### ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

âœ… A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories

âœ… `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.

âœ… `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
